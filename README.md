# SDC-T2-P2
Udacity Self-Drving-Car Term2 P2 Unscented Kalman Filter

## Implemenation
Most of the code are from the UKF course. No need to further explain here.

## Result
Output results in folder CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project/output:
*  output-file.txt is the config in sheme to output prediction into.
*  NIS.png,est-meas.png,est-gt.png is generated by the ukf-visulization notebook provided by the project.
*  output_from_console is copied from console output, which indicates my px, py, vx, and vy RMSE is [0.0595275,0.0870744,0.33396,0.220836] that meets the criterion (< [.09, .10, 0.40, 0.30]).

### NIS
![](https://github.com/qitong/SDC-T2-P2/raw/master/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project/output/NIS.png)  
Most of the plotted NIS are under the chi square criterion (7.815), indicated that the result is consistent.
